Set aside.Mix the egg with the tablespoon of cold water. Set aside.\nNow comes the ‚Äúsanding‚Äù process, which is when you add the cold cubed butter. I use a food processor‚Äîbelieve me, it saves a ton of time! If you don‚Äôt have one, use a fork. Avoid using your hands because they transfer heat. Once the mixture has a sandy texture, add the egg and water mixture. Mix only until the dough comes together‚Äîdon‚Äôt overwork it.\nYou can finish bringing it together with your hands and flatten the dough to freeze it for 1 hour.I don‚Äôt freeze it as a ball, but rolled out instead. That way, it‚Äôs easier to roll out later.\nAfter 1 hour, take it out and roll it out with a rolling pin to about ¬Ω cm thick. Place it in a high-sided 23 cm round tart pan (I didn‚Äôt have that one, so I used a square pan). Place the dough in the pan, trim off the excess (bake the leftover scraps on a tray‚Äîthey‚Äôre delicious!), and freeze again for 30 minutes. Prick the base of the dough with a fork.\nOnce the 30 minutes in the freezer are done, bake at 365¬∞F (185¬∞C) for 25‚Äì30 minutes.Make sure to place parchment paper on top of the crust and weigh it down with beans (or any pie weights‚Äîyou can save and reuse them).\nImportant: Grease the tart pan well with butter on all sides and dust it with flour. This is a great tip to prevent the crust from sticking.\nAfter the initial 25‚Äì30 minutes of baking (the edges should be golden), remove the parchment paper and weights, and bake for 5 more minutes.\n\nFilling\n* 800 g sweetened condensed milk\n* 3 egg yolks\n* 200 ml lemon juice (100 ml regular lemon + 100 ml key lime or Persian lime)\nMix all the ingredients and set aside.\nYou can pour the filling into the crust when it‚Äôs still warm.\nReturn it to the oven at the same temperature for 15 more minutes.\nOnce completely cool (at least 5 hours), you can add the meringue.\n\nMeringue\n* 100 g egg whites\n* 200 g sugar\nMix in a metal bowl over a double boiler, stirring constantly until the sugar crystals are completely dissolved.Be careful not to overcook!\nOnce dissolved (use a whisk and stir with enthusiasm‚Äîalmost like dancing!), beat with a hand mixer or stand mixer on high speed for 15 minutes.\nSpread the meringue over the pie and let it sit overnight. (Highly recommended!)\n\nHope you enjoy it!",

But confit style, which this may not be.  \nWhole Pork Belly cured (If I remember correctly, 24hrs minimum) by covering it in rock salt, rosemary and garlic, after scoring the fat side with a knife.  \nThen confit it in fat (ok it can get a bit pricey and difficult for a home cook). Very slow cook for about 3 or 4 hours.  \nTake the belly out of the fat and FLATTEN THE \\*\\*\\*\\* out of it (we'd have it in one metal tray and push down another on top and weigh it down tight, fat side down to make it flatter).  \nThen when cooled you cut it into cubes and you can put it fat down in a hot pan. Slap it in an oven to heat through properly and there's your crispy pork belly.  \nServed with white beans cooked in butter and rosemary.",

    "selftext": "Have you ever wanted a Beef Wellington for lunch at work but nobody has one ready to go? Problem solved with these Beef Wellington Bites ü§£\n\nI don't really think this makes the process any quicker, if anything it probably takes longer to do this than it does to make a full size one üòÖ\n\nI started with the duxelles because it takes a little bit to cook down the shrooms. About halfway through I added minced shallots, garlic, and a little thyme.\n\nIn the same pan, I seard some chunks of costco flap meat in butter then chilled them. While that cools, cook shallots and garlic in the butter until soft, a little s&p, then red wine and let it reduce.\n\nWhile it reduces, wrap the beef in prosciutto with the duxelles, wrap & roll tight, then chill again.\n\nWhen the red wine is mostly gone, add beef stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Simmer and reduce by about half, strain out all the solids, adjust s&p to taste, and keep on low heat. If you'd rather have a thick gravy, now would be the time to whisk in a cornstarch or flour slurry to thicken it up.\n\nWhile it reduces before straining it, wrap the chilled meat with puff pastry, roll it tight, and chill again ü§£\n\nPreheat the oven to 400¬∞, egg wash the pastry, bake until it browns, then dip and enjoy! These were great for work lunch the next day too, still tender without any need for a fork or knife üòÇ",

I just did them in batches then started over for the second fry. For the first fry pull them when they start to turn color and for the 2nd fry increase the heat and just let them crisp up then enjoy with your choice of dipping sauce üòÜ\n\nI haven't tried the Taco Bell ones so I have no idea how they compare ü§£\n\n\n",
